It's time to install Node.js on our computer to get started with this course. So, without further ado let's head over to nodejs.org and then download the latest version of Node.js suitable for our computer. Heading over to nodejs.org, we notice that we have two versions of Node.js available for us. I'm going to download the latest current version of Node.js, the stable version. Once the installer is downloaded, double-click on it to proceed ahead with the installation of Node.js and it should bring up an installation screen which might look like this depending on the specific platform on which you are installing Node.js. So, the rest of the course is going to depend upon these versions of Node.js. Continuing with the installation. Once the installation is completed, then you can verify the version of Node.js by typing node minus v and the prompt and check the version of node and similarly npm minus v at the prompt to check the version of npm that has been installed on your computer.
